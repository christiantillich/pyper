...Creation...
user -> recipe ++ : instantiate class, params, and data

...Basic IO and Data Storage...
recipe -> recipe: .show_data() returns list of data names
recipe -> disk ++ : .read(data_name)
return: data as pandas.DataFrame

...Adding Features...
recipe -> feature ++ : .add_feature(func, func_params, step_params, ...)
return: add feature to recipe.features

...Adding Checks...
recipe -> check ++ : .add_check(func, check_params)
return: add check to recipe.checks

...Creating Steps...
recipe -> steps ++: ._prepare()
steps -> step ++: steps.create_step(feature, checks)
step -> step: look up data from recipe.data
step -> step: create step.run() as feature.func(data, **func_params)
step -> step: create step.check() as check(data, **check_params) for all checks
return: repeat for all features
return: steps created

...Running...
recipe -> steps ++: .run(), first do new ._prepare()
steps -> step ++: for all features
return: prepare the steps
steps -> step ++: for each step
step -> step: step.run()
step -> step: run_all_checks()
return: check results as columns in data frame. 
steps -> disk ++: steps.write(pd.concat(check_data))
return: confirmation
return: user specifies output data, log, or none. 

...Fin...
return: close session
